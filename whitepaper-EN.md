# Jinbao Protocol: DeFi 4.0
**Subverting Traditional Design Concepts, Opening a New Era of Dual-Token Sustainable Growth!**

## I. JBC Allocation Mechanism and Trading Rules

- **Total Supply:** 100 Million JBC
  - **Liquidity Pool (LP):** 5 Million (Permissions Relinquished/Burnt)
  - **Liquidity Mining Output:** 95 Million
- **Sell Slippage:** 25% (25% sent to Black Hole Address for burning)
- **Buy Slippage:** 50% (50% sent to Black Hole Address for burning)
- **Daily Deflation:** 1% of the JBC Liquidity Pool is automatically burnt daily.
- **Selling Mechanism:** When selling JBC, 50% of the token amount is directly burnt, and 50% returns to the pool. The user receives the USDT/MC value equivalent to the original transaction amount.
  - *Example:* If JBC price is $1 and a user sells 100 JBC: 50 JBC go to the black hole (burnt), 50 JBC return to the pool, and the user receives $100 worth of MC.

## II. Participation Mechanism & Dynamic/Static Rewards

### 1. Ticket Fund Allocation (Based on Ticket Amount)
Ticket Tiers: 100 MC, 300 MC, 500 MC, 1000 MC

- **25%** - Direct Referral Reward
- **15%** - Level Reward (1% per order for up to 15 layers)
  - Refer 1 active address: Earn from 5 layers
  - Refer 2 active addresses: Earn from 10 layers
  - Refer 3 active addresses: Earn from 15 layers
- **5%** - Marketing Fund
- **5%** - Direct Buyback (Enters pool to buy JBC)
- **25%** - Liquidity Injection (Adds to pool depth)
- **25%** - Treasury Fund (Gold-Backed Reserve)

### 2. Liquidity Requirements
- **100 MC Ticket:** Requires 150 MC Liquidity
- **300 MC Ticket:** Requires 450 MC Liquidity
- **500 MC Ticket:** Requires 750 MC Liquidity
- **1000 MC Ticket:** Requires 1500 MC Liquidity

### 3. Liquidity Mining Rewards (Based on Ticket Amount)
- **7-Day Cycle:** 2.0% Daily
- **15-Day Cycle:** 2.5% Daily
- **30-Day Cycle:** 3.0% Daily

### 4. Settlement Mechanism
- **Input:** MC
- **Output:** 50% MC + 50% JBC
- **Settlement:** MC is Coin-Based; JBC is Gold-Based (Value-Based).
  - *Example:* Enter with 100 MC Ticket, 2% daily rate. 7-day total revenue is 14 MC. Settlement will be 7 MC + JBC equivalent to 7 MC value (calculated based on JBC price at the time of distribution).
  - *Note on JBC Settlement:* JBC amount is calculated at the time of claim. If redemption fee is not paid immediately after cycle expiry, JBC amount floats with market price until the redemption fee is paid, locking in the quantity at that moment.

## III. Ticket Purchase and Participation Rules

### 1. Ticket Purchase Rule
Taking 100 MC Ticket + 150 MC Liquidity as an example:
- User transfers 100 MC to the contract address to buy a ticket.
- **3x Cap:** Enjoy 3x dynamic and static coin-based revenue limit (based on ticket amount).
- **Time Limit:** Liquidity (150 MC) must be provided within **72 hours** after ticket purchase; otherwise, the ticket automatically expires.

### 2. Liquidity Mining & Redemption
- User provides 150 MC liquidity to the contract.
- **Cycle End:** After 30 days (720 hours), earnings stop.
- **Redemption:** User must pay a **Redemption Fee** (e.g., 1% of Ticket Amount, 10 MC in original text context seems high for 1%, likely 1% of total or fixed fee, assuming 1% based on UI text) to the contract.
- **Payout:** Contract automatically returns: `Principal Liquidity (150 MC)` + `Interest (MC & JBC)` + `Redemption Fee Return (10 MC)`.
- **Out Rule:** Once total dynamic/static revenue reaches **3x** the ticket amount, the user is "Out" and must purchase a new ticket to continue earning.

## IV. V-Series Differential Fission Mechanism (Team Rewards)

Earn **5% to 45%** differential rewards based on team performance.

| Level | Required Active Addresses | Differential Reward Ratio |
| :---: | :-----------------------: | :-----------------------: |
| **V1**| 10                        | 5%                        |
| **V2**| 30                        | 10%                       |
| **V3**| 100                       | 15%                       |
| **V4**| 300                       | 20%                       |
| **V5**| 1,000                     | 25%                       |
| **V6**| 3,000                     | 30%                       |
| **V7**| 10,000                    | 35%                       |
| **V8**| 30,000                    | 40%                       |
| **V9**| 100,000                   | 45%                       |

## V. Dual Token Burning & Sustainable Growth Design

1. **Double Revenue:** One investment, two types of asset returns (MC + JBC).
2. **Transparency:** Fully open and transparent; Contract permissions relinquished.
3. **Strong Foundation:** Multi-insurance backing (Gold Reserves + Treasury), designed for longevity.
